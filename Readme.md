This web app is currently being developed.

## Introduction
This is a web app designed to organize your professional activities. It has roles that allow client and professional to exchange data to overcome a particular service. Both should be logged in into the platform to interact with their features, so far we use google authentication so only google accounts can join.

## Tech Stack
- Express
- Mongoose
- JWT authentication using Passport.JS
- Logging (winston/morgan)
- Sentry to analyze error logs
- Docker
- React (React Context to deal with state management)
- Material UI
- Jest + testing-library

## Run
Project is executed using this command over /app folder:

$ docker-compose up --build
or
$ docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml up --build

You'll have a backend server listening on localhost:3001 and frontend server listening on localhost:3000. Every code update will generate a page reload.

## Project Structure

### Express Server

Structure is based on express-generator project, on top of that we are trying to:
1. Provide a separate section for server initialization stage (db, routes, logger, etc)
2. Have our business logic divided into components/modules

```
.
└── app
    ├── bin                    
    |   ├── www                   // Node js entry point file
    ├── config                    // configuration files for specific environments
    |   ├── env
    |   |   ├── default.js

    |   |   └── users.routes.js
    |   |   └── users.tests.js
    |   ├── models.js             // initialize all models db schemas

Here are some guides I based project structure on:

### React Client
Client project structure was based on create-react-app project, what is interesting to show is how we deal with React asynchronous operations, using React Context tool. The idea is to have multiple providers to deal with state management.

```
.
└── client
    ├── src                    
    |   ├── components   
    |   |   ├── Header       
    |   |   |   ├── index.js       
    |   |   |   ├── header.test.js       
    |   |   ...       
    |   |   ...       
    |   ├── context   
    |   |   ├── AppProvider       
    |   |   |   ├── actions.js       
    |   |   |   ├── api.js       
    |   |   |   ├── reducer.js       
    |   |   |   └── store.js
    |   |   ...       
    |   |   ...       
    |   ├── layouts           
    |   ├── views   
    ├── App.js
    |   ... 
    |   ...       
```

### VSC Debug configuration
You may want to add this configuration into VSC to debug server code:

```` javascript
  {
    "name": "Docker: Virtual Office",
    "type": "node",
    "request": "attach",
    "port": 9229,
    "address": "localhost",
    "protocol": "inspector",
    "restart": false,
    "sourceMaps": false,
    "outFiles": [],
    "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/app",
    "remoteRoot": "/opt/app/virtualoffice-app"
  }
````
